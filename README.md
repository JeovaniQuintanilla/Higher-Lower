# Higher-Lower
A simple High-Low guessing game built in Python using Tkinter for the graphical interface. Players guess whether the next card will be higher or lower than the current one.

This project is structured using two core classes:
  * Card Class – Represents individual cards, holding attributes such as suit and value.
  * Deck Class – Manages a full deck of cards.
